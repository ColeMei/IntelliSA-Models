# Fresh Start - New Improved Workflow

## ✅ Project Status: READY FOR NEW WORKFLOW

This project has been completely cleaned and is ready for the new improved workflow.

## What Was Removed:
- ❌ All old model files (safely backed up)
- ❌ All old results (safely backed up) 
- ❌ All old training logs (safely backed up)
- ❌ temp_storage/ directory (replaced by fast /tmp)

## What Was Preserved:
- ✅ Source code and configurations
- ✅ Training data (data/processed/)
- ✅ Recent SLURM outputs
- ✅ Complete backup at: backup_20250829_133950

## New Workflow Features:
- **Fast Storage**: Uses /tmp (NVMe) for training operations
- **No Overwrites**: Models saved as `model_TIMESTAMP_jobID/`
- **Symlinks**: `model_latest` points to most recent model
- **Complete Archives**: Full job results in `results/run_JOBID_TIMESTAMP/`

## Expected Structure After First New Training:
```
models/
├── encoder_20250829_143022_job12345/     # Timestamped model
├── encoder_latest -> encoder_20250829_143022_job12345  # Symlink
└── evaluation/

results/
└── run_12345_20250829_143022/    # Complete job archive
    ├── model/                    # Model files
    ├── config_used.yaml         # Configuration  
    ├── training_12345.log       # Training log
    └── slurm.out/err            # SLURM outputs
```

## Next Steps:
1. ✅ Project is clean and ready
2. 🚀 Submit jobs using updated SLURM scripts
3. 📊 Models will be saved with timestamps
4. 📁 Complete job archives will be created automatically

## Backup Location:
🔒 Full backup of old structure: backup_20250829_133950
